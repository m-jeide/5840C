                    "description": "As Micah worked on the intake structure, Matthew, Varun, and Omri built a prototype launching mechanism. This system was designed to deploy pre-stored blocks using high-traction VEX Flex Wheels powered by low gear ratio motors. The objective was to propel the scoring objects onto an adjustable ramp, provided the launch velocity proved sufficient. However, the prototype was not completed by the end of this meeting."
