                    "description": "As work continued on the chassis, Matthew, Varun, and Omri began prototyping a separate launching mechanism. The initial concept was a flywheel-style system using high-traction VEX Flex Wheels and a gear train to achieve a high launch velocity. The goal was to test if this design could propel scoring objects with enough force to travel up a ramp. The prototype was not fully assembled by the end of the meeting."
