                    "description": "The new intake prototype transitions from a conveyor-style design to a roller-based intake. The previous conveyor system suffered from jamming and standoff damage, especially at high speeds when belt slack caused collisions between standoffs. The new roller design eliminates belts entirely, instead using paired rollers to guide and intake blocks more reliably."

            "content": "During this practice, the team successfully tested the new roller intake prototype, which showed far fewer jams and less passive stress on the standoffs compared to the earlier conveyor-based design. The roller setup provided smoother intake and more reliable performance. At the same time, Matthew and Omri were fully engaged in brainstorming launcher concepts, dedicating the session to exploring potential designs and mechanisms for future development."

To give context, our advisor Ms. Guzman introduces interested students to the program and evaluates their commitment. Once qualified, team placement is guided by a semi-preference system: students usually join their first-choice team unless it is already too large or too loud compared to others. Since 5840C is the smallest of the four teams, there’s a strong chance we’ll be welcoming some of today’s visitors onto our roster. We’re excited for the new talent and energy they could bring!"
