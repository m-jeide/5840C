            "content": "This meeting marked a major strategic pivot. After analyzing the geometry of the field and the goals, we concluded that our flywheel mechanism, while effective for intake, is not viable for scoring. Its angle and position make it unable to deposit objects effectively. Therefore, we have redefined the robot's architecture: the flywheel will now be a dedicated collection and storage system. Our primary design focus moving forward will be the creation of a completely separate, secondary mechanism dedicated solely to scoring."

                    "description": "The main activity of the meeting was this hands-on analysis. By manually placing a scoring object on the robot and aligning it with a goal, we visually confirmed the flywheel's inability to score. This simple test was the catalyst for our decision to pursue a two-system design, as it clearly demonstrated the need for a different mechanism to handle the final step of scoring."
