These paddles were intended to index and carry blocks upward toward the launching wheels, which would then accelerate the objects onto a scoring ramp. The images show the ongoing construction process and assembly of the conveyor system."

            "content": "During testing, we observed that at higher motor speeds the standoffs experienced stress and occasionally jammed against the blocks, locking the conveyor. In some cases, this stress damaged the standoffs or risked them falling off entirely. At lower speeds, jamming still occurred but less frequently, and most blocks were moved successfully. We are currently deciding whether to attempt correction through programming (if possible) or to pursue a mechanical redesign. An additional consideration is optimizing between stability and speed to reduce standoff damage while maintaining effective block movement."
